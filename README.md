# Appirio Styles
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/appirio-tech/styles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/appirio-tech/styles)

## Development
The purpose of this repo is to share common styles, mixins, and variables.

## Releases
Create a branch and make a pull request into master. When you're ready to release, create a release with the new version number, and a Travis build will be launched automatically, which publishes the new version to npm.
